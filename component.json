    "description": "<fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/\">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>",
